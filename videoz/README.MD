# Videoz

Videoz is an example of a video sharing platform that is popular with kids.
However, like many similar systems, it is a mixed blessing. While it does
contain educational material and other high-quality content, it also contains
a lot of stuff that is, shall we say, less nutritional. Unfortunately, kids
[tend to gravitate to the latter].

The example is to be used with the [Torshi Katas] or simply as part of a
[BDD Kata like this one]. While Videoz already has child protection features,
as you can see when you browse the files here, it lacks functionality for
carers to foster media education. The Kata can use this as a conceptual basis
for practicing, for example, Example Mapping or the writing of Gherkin specs.
